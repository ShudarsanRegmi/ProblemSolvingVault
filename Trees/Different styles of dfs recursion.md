Certainly! Below are different ways of framing the same depth-first search (DFS) logic for solving the problem of checking if there is a path with a given sum in a binary tree. These versions vary in the recursive structure and how the answer is passed or returned.

---

### 1. **Using Return Values for Recursion (No Global Variables)**

In this style, we return the result directly from the recursive function, avoiding the need for a global variable like `ans`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool dfs(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, int sum) {
        if (!root) return false;
        
        sum += root->val;
        
        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            return sum == targetSum;
        }
        
        return dfs(root->left, targetSum, sum) || dfs(root->right, targetSum, sum);
    }
    
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        return dfs(root, targetSum, 0);
    }
};
```

- **Key Difference**: The DFS function now returns `true` or `false` directly, and the `hasPathSum` function simply invokes `dfs` and returns its result.

---

### 2. **Early Return in DFS (Inline Return)**

This version avoids unnecessary depth by returning early when a valid path is found.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool dfs(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, int sum) {
        if (!root) return false;
        
        sum += root->val;
        
        if (!root->left && !root->right) return sum == targetSum;
        
        return dfs(root->left, targetSum, sum) || dfs(root->right, targetSum, sum);
    }
    
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        return root ? dfs(root, targetSum, 0) : false;
    }
};
```

- **Key Difference**: A cleaner and quicker exit is facilitated by inline returns in the DFS method itself.

---

### 3. **Returning a Boolean from DFS (Boolean Propagation)**

This style has `dfs` directly returning a boolean value, and `hasPathSum` merely calls `dfs`.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool dfs(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, int sum) {
        if (!root) return false;
        
        sum += root->val;
        
        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            return sum == targetSum;
        }
        
        return dfs(root->left, targetSum, sum) || dfs(root->right, targetSum, sum);
    }
    
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        return dfs(root, targetSum, 0);
    }
};
```

- **Key Difference**: The recursive DFS function performs all checks and returns the result directly. The `hasPathSum` function becomes just a call to `dfs`.

---

### 4. **Tail Recursion Style**

In this version, we attempt to use tail recursion by having the recursive call as the last operation in the function.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool dfs(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, int sum) {
        if (!root) return false;
        
        sum += root->val;
        
        if (!root->left && !root->right) {
            return sum == targetSum;
        }
        
        if (dfs(root->left, targetSum, sum)) return true;
        if (dfs(root->right, targetSum, sum)) return true;
        
        return false;
    }
    
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        return dfs(root, targetSum, 0);
    }
};
```

- **Key Difference**: Tail recursion where each recursive call has its own base case check before checking the next branch. This method doesn't use `||` but returns `true` immediately if any path sum matches.

---

### 5. **Boolean Flag Propagation Through Recursion**

This is similar to the original approach, but instead of using a global variable, we pass a boolean flag in the recursion to stop further processing once a solution is found.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    void dfs(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, int sum, bool& found) {
        if (!root || found) return;
        
        sum += root->val;
        
        if (!root->left && !root->right && sum == targetSum) {
            found = true;
            return;
        }
        
        dfs(root->left, targetSum, sum, found);
        dfs(root->right, targetSum, sum, found);
    }
    
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        bool found = false;
        dfs(root, targetSum, 0, found);
        return found;
    }
};
```

- **Key Difference**: We pass a reference to a `bool` variable (`found`) through the recursion chain to stop the search once a valid path is found.

---

### 6. **DFS with Helper Function Returning Boolean**

This approach uses a helper function to return a boolean, making it cleaner and avoiding the need for global or external state.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool dfs(TreeNode* root, int targetSum, int sum) {
        if (!root) return false;
        
        sum += root->val;
        
        if (!root->left && !root->right) return sum == targetSum;
        
        return dfs(root->left, targetSum, sum) || dfs(root->right, targetSum, sum);
    }
    
    bool hasPathSum(TreeNode* root, int targetSum) {
        return dfs(root, targetSum, 0);
    }
};
```

- **Key Difference**: The helper function is used to directly evaluate the result of `dfs` and avoid the need for extra variables outside the helper scope.

---

### Summary of Differences:

- **Global variable vs. Boolean return values**: Some methods use a global variable (`ans`) to store the result, while others return a boolean directly from the DFS function.
- **Tail recursion vs. traditional recursion**: In some cases, tail recursion is used, while in others, each recursive call checks both children before returning.
- **Early termination**: Some methods terminate recursion early when the path sum is found, while others continue recursively checking both subtrees until all possibilities are explored.

Each of these recursive formulations of the problem provides a slightly different approach to framing the problem while maintaining the DFS logic intact.
