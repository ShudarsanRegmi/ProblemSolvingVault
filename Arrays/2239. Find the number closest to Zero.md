Hint

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, return _the number with the value **closest** to_ `0` _in_ `nums`. If there are multiple answers, return _the number with the **largest** value_.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** nums = [-4,-2,1,4,8]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:**
The distance from -4 to 0 is |-4| = 4.
The distance from -2 to 0 is |-2| = 2.
The distance from 1 to 0 is |1| = 1.
The distance from 4 to 0 is |4| = 4.
The distance from 8 to 0 is |8| = 8.
Thus, the closest number to 0 in the array is 1.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [2,-1,1]
**Output:** 1
**Explanation:** 1 and -1 are both the closest numbers to 0, so 1 being larger is returned.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `-105 <= nums[i] <= 105`

                mind = i;
            }

            if (d == abs(mind)){
                if (i>mind) {
                    mind = i;
                }
